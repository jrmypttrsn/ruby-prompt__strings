# What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters.

# What are some examples of information that would be Strings as opposed to some other data type?

An example of a string is "One plus one equals two"

# What is one way, using Ruby, to retrieve the 6th character in a String like `"Ada Lovelace"`? How about the 8th character? What happens if you try to retrieve the value of the _99th_ character (Or any character that doesn't exist)?

"Ada Lovelace".index('6') "Ada Lovelace".index('8') If you try to retrieve a character that does not exist, it should return nil.

# The previous question asks about finding, for example, the 6th character in a String. Is it possible to find the **-6th** (Notice the negative symbol!) character in a String? What does that even mean?

-6 would find the sixth character from the end.

# What is one way, using Ruby, to replace certain characters in a string with some other set of characters? For example, given `"Sumeet Jain"`, how would you replace all of the `e` characters in my name with exclamation marks? (So it would be `"Sum!!t Jain"`.)

"Sumeet Jain".gsub(/[e]/, '!')
